[size=12pt][color=orange]Usage Terms AKA Licensing[/color][/size]

You are free to use CCL in any mod or modpack.  If you are creating a mod using CCL, do not include CCL with your mod.  This is not a license issue but a compatibility issue.  Simply state the minimum version of CCL which you require and link[sup][size=8pt]1[/size][/sup] to this thread.  You can include CCL with a modpack however, it is recommended that you don't.  It is better to link[sup][size=8pt]8.1[/size][/sup] to this forum thread to allow users to separately download and update.

For more information on the license CCL is released under, please refer to [url=http://unlicense.org/]the unlicense[/url].
