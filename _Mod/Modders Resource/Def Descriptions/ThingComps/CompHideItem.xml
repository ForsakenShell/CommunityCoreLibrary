    ThingComp:  CompHideItem
    
    This comp will disable calling of the Draw() and DrawGUIOverlay() on items in the same cells
    as the building it is applied to.  This means the item(s) in the same cells as the building
    will not be drawn nor will it's label.
    
    Ticking is not required for this component to work as the check is done in the comps PostDraw()
    method every 20 ticks (hashed by the buildings hash code to prevent "lag spikes").  The items
    are registered with a map component which will maintain the hiden status between saves and on
    partial removal of item stacks (when a stack of items is split off and there are some remaining).
    
    The map component which maintains the hidden status will recheck all items registered every 20
    ticks so the longest an item may be visible for is 40 ticks (2/3 of a second).  Items removed from
    a cell the building occupied will remain hidden until the entire recheck cycle is complete which,
    again, may take as long as 40 ticks.
    
    This comp can be applied to any building which could have items in the same cell as the building
    it is applied to be it a storage building or work table.
    
    If used on a building extending the Building_Storage class, the new building class can call this
    comps ReceivedThing() and LostThing() methods to improve the rate at which the items are hidden
    and shown however, there will still be the map component delay of up to 20 ticks.
    
    By using the PostDraw() method of the comp to check for items, no unnecessary ticking is required
    to handle edge cases (single stack items, partial stack removal, game load, etc).  Because of the
    check being handled in the PostDraw() method, items can not be hidden and shown from within the
    render call chain and a map component is used to maintain a master list of items and handles the
    render state change in the ticking call chain.
