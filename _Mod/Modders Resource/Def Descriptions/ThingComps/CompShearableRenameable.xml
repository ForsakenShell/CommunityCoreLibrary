    ThingComp:  CompShearableRenameable
    
    Requires:   CompProperties_ShearableRenameable
    
    Using CompShearableRenameable allows you to specify a custom growth string for your resource,
    e.g. "Alpaca wool growth" on an alpaca, "Feather growth" on a chicken, etc. This is in contrast to
    vanilla's CompShearable which will always display "wool growth" regardless of the resource harvested.
    Beyond that usage is identical to CompShearable and not specifying any string will default to the
    vanilla value for maximum compatibility and ease of use, simply do not specify a string if you don't
    need any custom text and it will act identical to CompShearable.
    
    The only difference between this comp and CompMilkableRenameable is the specific xml tags and the
    job report string.  This comp will report "Shearing TargetA".
    
    XML Data:
    
    type (default)  tag                 Details
    
    string          growthLabel         [optional] Label that will show up in the inspect tab
       ("Wool growth")
    ThingDef (null) woolDef             [optional] Item that will appear when harvested
    int (0)         shearIntervalDays   [optional] Amount of days to go from 0% growth to 100%
    int (1)         woolAmount          [optional] Amount of items dropped on harvest
