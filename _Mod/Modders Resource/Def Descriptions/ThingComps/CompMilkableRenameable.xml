    ThingComp:  CompMilkableRenameable
    
    Requires:   CompProperties_MilkableRenameable
    
    Using CompMilkableRenameable allows you to specify a custom growth string for your resource,
    e.g. "chemical growth" on a boomalope which can be harvested for explosives, "venom fullness" on a
    snake, etc. This is in contrast to vanilla's CompMilkable which will always display "milk fullness"
    regardless of the resource harvested. Beyond that usage is identical to CompMilkable and not
    specifying any string will default to the vanilla value for maximum compatibility and ease of use,
    simply do not specify a string if you don't need any custom text and it will act identical to
    CompMilkable.
    
    The only difference between this comp and CompShearableRenameable is the specific xml tags and the
    job report string.  This comp will report "Milking TargetA".
