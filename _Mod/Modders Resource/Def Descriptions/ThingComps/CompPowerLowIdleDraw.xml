    Optional:   CompGlower
    
    CompPowerLowIdleDraw (comp idle power), will modify the power usage of a building based on
    it's operational mode.  Modes curently include "InUse" (work tables), "WhenNear" (pawn is in
    any cell the building uses or in any adjacent cell to the building) and "Cycle" (operates in
    "full power" mode for a specified number of ticks then in "low power" mode for a specified
    number of ticks, cycling between modes).
    
    Comp Properties:
    
    type (default)  tag                 Details
    
    float (0)       idlePowerFactor     [optional] Idle-power basePowerConsumption multiplier
    enum (InUse)    operationalMode     [optional] Power switching mode
    int (*)         cycleLowTicks       [optional] Number of normal ticks to operate in low-power mode
    int (*)         cycleHighTicks      [optional] Number of normal ticks to operate in high-power mode
    
    * These values are variable depending on the operationalMode.  Note that at the end of
    a cycle power may not be switched if the conditions would allow it to stay in that mode.
    The default values are as follows:
        
        mode        low     high    Example usage
