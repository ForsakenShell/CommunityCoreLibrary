    CompPowerLowIdleDraw (comp idle power), will modify the power usage of a building based on
    it's operational mode.  The mode options, default values and useage examples are listed below.
    
    Comp Properties:
    
    type (default)  tag                 Details
    
    float (0*)      idlePowerFactor     [optional] Idle-power basePowerConsumption multiplier
    enum (InUse)    operationalMode     [optional] Power switching mode
    int (**)        cycleLowTicks       [optional] Number of normal ticks to operate in low-power mode
    int (**)        cycleHighTicks      [optional] Number of normal ticks to operate in high-power mode
    
    * If idlePowerFactor is less than 1.0f, then the value is multiplied with the basePowerConsumption
    to determine the low power usage.  Otherwise, the value is taken as the fixed low power usage (eg,
    10 is taken as directly as 10 watts).
    
    ** These values are variable depending on the operationalMode.  Note that at the end of
    a cycle power may not be switched if the conditions would allow it to stay in that mode.
    The default values are as follows:
        
        mode            low     high    Example usage
