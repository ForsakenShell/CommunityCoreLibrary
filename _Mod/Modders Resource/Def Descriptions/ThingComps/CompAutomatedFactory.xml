    This comp stores flags and values for controlling the behaviour of Building_AutomatedFactory.  All the
    flags and values are stored in this comps properties and are listed below.
    
    Comp Properties:
    
    type (default)  tag                 Details
    
    FactoryOutputVector                 [required] Controls how a product is dispensed when production is complete.
        (Invalid)   outputVector        Valid values are "DirectToPawn", "Ground" and "InteractionCell".  "Ground"
                                        output will try to output first to a storage building which accepts it's
                                        output if one is found but there is not room, production will be suspended until
                                        the building is clear.  If no valid storage building is found, it will look
                                        for an existing stack of what it is trying to output which is beside the building.
                                        Finally, if none of the above conditions are met, it will output to any free
                                        open cell around it.
    
    FactoryProductionMode               [required] Determines how the factory should operate.  "PawnInteractionOnly"
        (None)      productionMode      will only produce when a pawn is directly try to take from the building (such
                                        as a meal) and "Automatic" will keep producing recipes as long as the building
                                        is powered and has resources in hoppers.
