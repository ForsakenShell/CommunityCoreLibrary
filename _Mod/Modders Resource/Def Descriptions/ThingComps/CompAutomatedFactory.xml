    This comp stores flags and values for controlling the behaviour of Building_AutomatedFactory.  All the
    flags and values are stored in this comps properties and are listed below.
    
    Comp Properties:
    
    type (default)  tag                 Details
    
    FactoryOutputVector                 [required] Controls how a product is dispensed when production is complete.
        (Invalid)   outputVector        Valid values are "DirectToPawn", "Ground" and "InteractionCell".  "Ground"
                                        output will try to output first to a storage building which accepts it's
                                        output then, to an existing stack of that output which is beside the building
                                        finally, to any free open cell around it.
    
    FactoryProductionMode               [required] Determines how the factory should operate.  "PawnInteractionOnly"
        (None)      productionMode      will only produce when a pawn is directly try to take from the building (such
                                        as a meal) and "Automatic" will keep producing recipes as long as the building
                                        is powered and has resources in hoppers.
