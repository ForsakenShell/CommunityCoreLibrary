        <Verbosity>enum*</Verbosity>    [optional] Sets the level of logging output CCL will perform when performing tasks specific to your mod

    </ModHelperDef>

    * Verbosity is an enumeration and works with named levels, each level adds more and more information to the output log.
    Each level of verbosity includes the information of all the levels above it.
    The user release build only supports FatalErrors, NonFatalErrors and Validation.
    The modders release supports the following:
        FatalErrors
        NonFatalErrors
        Validation
        Warnings
        Injections
        AutoGenCreation
        StateChanges
        Stack (Use with caution, this will trace certain methods and some methods are recursive)
    
    For both the user release and modders release the default verbosity is "Validation"

    While the user release will not report anything higher than validation, you should still remove (or comment) the xml tag
    for verbosity before releasing your mod.  The higher levels of verbosity will help track down bugs in both your mod and
    potentially within CCL itself for reporting to the github issues tracker.

    NOTE:  Only create one ModHelperDef for your mod, if more than one is found then an error will be thrown and any advanced
    functionality requiring information contained within the ModHelperDef (such as injections, AdvancedResearchDefs, etc) will be
    disabled.
