    All SequencedInjectionSets use these common fields (this is the base class).
    
    Fields such as injectionSequence and injectionTiming are set by the specific injection class to the
    default value for the class but may be overriden in the XML.  Note that InjectionSequence.DLLLoad is
    not available for XML injections as the assembly is loaded before XML and thus no XML information is
    available when the DLL is loaded.
    
    Sequenced injections are handled in priority order then mod order.  All mods injections will be
    interleaved in the sequence based on timing from Priority_25 to Priority_0.
    
    <li>

        <injectionSequence>InjectionSequence</injectionSequence>
                                        [optional] Sequence this injector should be executed in
        <injectionTiming>InjectionTiming</injectionTiming>
                                        [optional] Timing within sequence this injector should be executed in
        
        <requiredMod>string</requiredMod>
                                        [optional] Name of required mod to perform this injection

        <targetDef>Def*</targetDef>     [optional*] Specific target def for single target injectors
        
        <targetDefs>                    [optional*] List of target Defs for multi-target injectors
            <li>Def*</li>
        </targetDefs>
        
        <qualifier>DefInjectionQualifier</qualifier>
                                        [optional*] Qualifier class to test individual Defs against from DefDatabase<> for multi-target injectors
    </li>

    Single target injectors must use targetDef to specify the target.
    
    Multi-target injectors must use targetDefs OR a qualifier class must be provided, if neither or both are provided an error will be thrown.

    * The specific Def class and targeting will be determined by the individual sequenced injection set.
