    This class of buildings will create products from recipes by taking resources from connected hoppers.  It
    can create work on a single recipe at a time and complete recipes which have a single product output.
    Currently, this building does not support recipes which create stuffable items.  This building is tied
    directly into the food sub-system so pawns can take meals directly from a factory in their normal course
    of searching for food.  When looking for meals, pawns will use the nutritional value of the meals which
    the building can provide and similarily for alcohol, pawns will use the joy factor.
    
    Recipes can be added or removed from the building via research and ticking is required to check for changes
    in the available recipes.  Recipes must have a single product.  Factories which directly output to pawns
    should only produce a single stack item (ie, a single meal instead of a stack of meals).  Factories which
    aren't used to produce meals or other ingestible items direct to pawns have no stack size restrictions.
    
    Ticking can be normal or rare, however, normal ticking will be more responsive*.
    
    The ITab_AutomatedFactory allows the player to control what recipes can be produced at any given time and supplies
    information about ingredients are required for the recipes.
    
    Recipes used with this building don't use the workers skills and don't need any tags relating to them.
    The only recipe tags which are relevant are as follows:
        defName
        label
        description**
        jobString***
        allowMixingIngredients
        ingredients
        fixedIngredientFilter
        defaultIngredientFilter
        products
        workAmount
    
    * Production ticking happens per tick, recipe checks happens once every 60 ticks.  Rare ticking counts 250 production ticks.
    ** Recipe description is only visible in the help menu.
    *** Recipe jobString is displayed in the buildings inspect string when it's producing
